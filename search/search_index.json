These are called \"orphans\" or \"ORFans\" if present in one species or \"taxonomically restricted genes\" (TRGs) at higher levels. Research on these genes is key to understanding their origins, but current software for identifying them is limited, complex, and has restricted database access. ORFanID is a user-friendly web-based tool that efficiently identifies orphan genes and TRGs across taxonomic levels, using sequences from large bioinformatics repositories like NCBI. It allows users to control search parameters and presents results in sortable, filterable tables with graphical displays of taxonomic trees.</p> JAVAFX Software Architect Google Cloud AWS Read more pridepy <p>The Proteomics Identification Database (PRIDE) is the world\u2019s largest repository for proteomics data and a founding member of ProteomeXchange. Here, we introduce pridepy, a Python client designed to access PRIDE Archive data, including project metadata and file downloads. pridepy offers a flexible programmatic interface for searching, retrieving, and downloading data via the PRIDE REST API. This tool simplifies the integration of PRIDE datasets into bioinformatics pipelines, making it easier for researchers to handle large datasets programmatically.</p> Python FTP Globus HPC Cluster Read more GeoDiver <p>GeoDiver is an online web application for performing Differential Gene Expression Analysis (DGEA) and Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment Analysis (GAGE) on gene expression datasets from the publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The output produced includes numerous high quality interactive graphics, allowing users to easily explore and examine complex datasets instantly. Furthermore, the results produced can be reviewed at a later date and shared with collaborators.</p> R language Ruby Sinatra MaterialisedCSS Read more Galaxy Plugin <p>This project developed ProExtractor, a Java library that extracts proteomics data from mzIdentML files and converts it into a lightweight JSON format. The ProViewer plugin, built with web technologies, visualizes this data interactively in Galaxy. ProExtractor is 83% faster than MzidToHTML, and ProViewer reduces visualization delays by 98% through caching. ProViewer is integrated into Galaxy and available on the public GIO Galaxy server, with an easy installation script for custom servers.</p> Visualisation Multi-threading AJAX XML parsing Read more Automated Bank Cheque Recongition System using OCR <p>Automated bank cheque details extraction using Optical Charactor Recongition system.
